## Tic-Tac-Toe

This repo contains an implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game written in React, following this [tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe). It contains three enhancements in addition to what the tutorial outlines:
1. In the list of moves, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button for the current move only.
2. Create Board using two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
3. A toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
